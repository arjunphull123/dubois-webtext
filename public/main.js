Du Bois conducted the first sociological case study of an American urban community in his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study. As highlighted by Aldon Morris, “the achievement of The Philadelphia Negro was that it was steeped in empirical data with charts and graphs, which enabled Du Bois to chronicle and analyze the experience of Black Philadelphians at the turn of the twentieth century.” In <i>Death Rate of Philadelphia by Age Periods, For 1890</i>, the viewer experiences how Du Bois's persistent use of data visualization highlights the inequities between life expectancy between Black and white citizens of Philadelphia during this time through a simple set of bar graphs. The 3D data visualization highlights how, in 2023, Black people still had a shorter life expectancy in comparison to white people and fared worse than whites across the majority of 32 examined measures of health according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Between 2019 and 2020, the life expectancy for all races/ethnicities declined. However, Black people saw a decrease from 74.7 to 71.8 years.",

                      "The inspiration for the content of my visualization titled Health and Income Across Race comes from W.E.B. DuBois’s data visualization titled Income and Expenditure of 150 Negro families in Atlanta, GA, USA which you can see in the youtube video in this section. Although the most informationally dense graph Du Bois and his team created, DuBois’ graph still manages to be a visual feast. Du Bois uses concise typography, clear photographs, and bright colors to educate his audience while the various bar charts highlight the differing budgetary discretions for Black families along class lines. In 1900, a head of household made an average of $1125 per year and would have been considered “well-to-do” according to Du Bois. With inflation, that would only amount to $33,996.59. As seen in the 3D visualization, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2019 median income seems like a significant improvement for Black heads of household at $44,000 until one considers the median income for comparative whites: $80,602. The median white American in their late fifties had $251,000 more wealth than the median Black American. Additionally, in terms of form, I was also inspired by a famous visualization called the “Gapminder Map” created by Hans Rosling (see Rosling et al., 2018). In this map, Rosling created an animated 2D visualization with the GDP and life expectancy of all the countries in the world plotted over time. You can view what this looks like by going to this link (Gapminder Foundation, 2009). The animation in this visualization shows how the health and financial parameters of countries are correlated and how they change over time which reveals startling insights about global development patterns over the last two centuries. I especially liked how the animation in this visualization shows how over time some countries have improved their economic well-being which has impacted their health outcomes as well, while others who continue to be economically oppressed suffer in terms of health outcomes as well. The animation helps us see these larger patterns which would’ve taken several 100 static graphs to convey. Using this as inspiration, I decided to see how health and income for different races in the US has varied over time in my data visualization.",
                      "Over time, I’ve felt that while data science does an excellent job of taking a lot of data and producing illuminating insights, it often lacks rhetorical capacities to move people to use those insights in meaningful ways. This is where digital rhetorical devices like animation and storytelling can come in very handy. In this particular visualization, I wanted to explore how animation could help with making data more meaningful. In this visualization, on the x-axis, you see median family income in dollars for different races in the US, and on the y-axis you see life expectancy for those races. The three different balls blue, red, and yellow represent African Americans, white Americans, and all other races respectively. Through an animation function, what you see is how this data changes over three decades between 1980-2017. Another interesting affordance here is that when one hovers over any of the balls, the specific data for that racial group in that time period appears over it, allowing users to dynamically interact with the data. As one starts to engage with this data, startling insights start to emerge. While for white Americans, both health and income have been steadily increasing over time, for African Americans, both parameters continue to lag behind. As recently as in 2017, there is a marked difference between life expectancy and income between African Americans and white Americans. Why do you think that is the case? What do you think this visualization tells us? What ways can you use it? The elements of animation along with the affordance of letting people see specific data points in time by hovering them strive to provide users with a panoramic view of the data, while including three dimensions - income, health, and time in a seemingly two dimensional figure. Such visualizations can be helpful in the classroom as starting points for political discussions about race, economics, and health. They can also be adapted for public awareness campaigns and in technical reports that seek to advocate for social change.",

                      "I created this visualization using a Javascript library called D3.js which is a very powerful library for creating data visualizations. The inspiration for this came from Rosling et al’s (2018) famous Gapminder visualization. While I do not have any formal background in Javascript, given my long term interest in digital rhetoric, I’ve been taking tutorials on different programming languages like Python. Recently, I started getting interested in D3.js through an online course on Udemy by Adam Janes (2020). In one of the modules for that class, Janes (2020) introduces his audience to Rosling’s Gapminder visualization and provides guidance on how to create such a visualization on their own. I studied Janes’ (2020) code for creating a Gapminder visualization available on Github. Then I started to brainstorm how I could create such a visualization with a different dataset and aesthetic for my purposes. I first wrote some pseudocode on how I could implement that for the health and income data for races in the US which I acquired from publicly available datasets like US Census Bureau (2023) and the National Center for Health Statistics (2020). Then I started converting the pseudocode into actual code using documentation for the D3.js library available through Bostock (2023) who is also the creator of the D3.js library. D3.js allows users to create an illusion of animation by helping them create an ‘update function’. This update function tells JavaScript that we have data values for different states of a graph (e.g. for different times) and we want to show these states one after the other rather than all together. The update function then transitions the visual elements of the graph (like the three balls in this case) from one state to another within the x-axis and y-axis of the canvas at quick, regular intervals which gives a sense of flow or animation.  This whole process was very challenging for me to implement and led to lots of errors and bugs. My code is not the most elegant but it gets the job done. For example, while Janes (2020) implementation of the visualization processes data present in a .csv file into a .json format using Javascript itself, I created the .json file by manually putting all the data as I wasn’t able to develop an error-free way to convert .csv into JSON using Javascript. This is not the most efficient and certainly not scalable for large datasets, but since I consider myself to be a beginner, I am happy that I could still get the job done. To assist me during this entire process, it was very helpful to learn from Eyman’s (2023) experiments with using OpenAI’s ChatGPT for web design.  used ChatGPT to assist me with brainstorming coding ideas and with debugging the code that I had written. Any coding suggestions given by ChatGPT were reviewed closely by me and corrected for errors."

The team incorporated a bold typeface for each section diagonally placed for maximum readability for the audience. The martial statistics today differ drastically. In 1900, 30% of black women aged 20-24 were married compared to 23% today. By 25-30, 73% of black women entered into holy matrimony versus only 43% today. Across all races, the speed and frequency at which people are getting married have decreased. However, the rates are even lower for black Americans. As a result of lower marriage rates, rapid inflation, housing discrimination, and targeted mass incarceration, the odds continue to stack against black families. The most alarming recent data shows how black families are more likely to experience racial discrimination in the child welfare system. Nearly 10 percent of Black children will be removed from their parents and placed into foster care (double the rate of white children,) according to the Center for the Study of Social Policy.

Du Bois. His visualization, which is visible in the YouTube video in this section, documents the rather rapid decrease in the number of Black Americans who could not read from Emancipation to the beginning of the 20th century. Just thirty years following the end of slavery, the literacy rate increased by 31.73%. Based on the previous data, Du Bois and his team estimated that black Americans would achieve 50% literacy by 1900 and represented this guess by incorporating question marks adjacent to the data. The realized data from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy determined the literacy rates for Black Americans actually fared better than their Atlanta University team imagined with 55.5% of Black people older than 14 years of age learning to read in 1900. As of 1979, less than 1.6% of Black Americans were believed to be illiterate. Despite this perceived progress, the U.S. Department of Education’s National Assessment of Educational Progress reported in 2019 that an astounding 85% of Black American students lack proficiency in reading skills. Additionally, 84% of these same students also struggle to show proficiency in math.",

But when you mix three-dimensional (3D) animation and Augmented Reality (AR) into it its power increases exponentially that converts insights and patterns in the data into stories that can inspire people to take action in the world. The purpose of the 3D, AR data visualization Illiteracy Rates in the U.S. (1860-1979) is to help audiences understand the immense difficulties that African Americans have had to overcome illiteracy. In this visualization, you see a 3D bar graph that shows illiteracy rates in the US starting from 1870-1980s. This gives you a bird’s eye view of the entire data spread in one go. The data contains 39 bars (13 decades with 3 data points about racial differences in illiteracy rates each). Representing all of them in a single 2-d graph frame would’ve made for a very cluttered experience. The bird’s eye view provided in a 3D bar graph makes it easier for us to visualize bigger datasets in one frame. As the visualization shows, in the 1870s, White Americans had a low illiteracy rate of 11.5%, but African Americans who have historically been denied access to education in the US, started with a staggeringly high illiteracy rate of 79%. The visualization tries to emphasize how much more difficult their struggle to overcome these inequalities has been to overcome these inequities when compared to other racial groups in the US. Apart from its 3-D elements, the augmented reality functions add an additional potential in it. Using that functionality, you can project this visualization in your classrooms, or at any other setting. For example, it could be projected on public buildings or other social settings related to the world of education to make a rhetorical argument about the connections between literacy and race.",

                      "The inspiration for my visualization titled Incarceration Across Race comes partially from Du Bois and his team’s analysis of the convictions of 3250 African American prisoners. Although their diagram (which is visible in the YouTube video linked in this section) is visually similar to a bar graph, it is actually more like an area chart in function. The slanted chart tells the viewer that the lion's share of convicted crimes committed by African Americans were against people (marked with the color brown) or property (marked with the color black). Curiously, Du Bois never compared the incarceration rates of Black Americans versus their white counterparts in a visualization, even though he did document the glaring differences between them in table formats in works like The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study (Du Bois, 2007, p. 168). In our own times, such facts have become ever more entrenched and hard to ignore at the national level in the US. Through publicly available prison census data that we accessed, we learnt that despite only representing 13.43% of America’s national population, Black Americans make up 33.6% of the incarcerated population in the US (Zeng, 2022). On the other hand, while white Americans make up 76.3% of the national population, they represent only 49.4% of the prison population (Zeng, 2022). This means that in terms of representational ratios, for every 1% of African Americans in the national population, there are 2.5% in the prison population while for every 1% of white Americans in the national population, there are only 0.65% in the prison population. Black Americans are thus nearly 4 times more overrepresented in prisons compared to their white counterparts. In terms of the inspiration for the specific form of this visualization, I used the idea of face-filters that was popularized by platforms like Snapchat where people could project funny features like animal faces and make up on their faces while video chatting. While platforms like snapchat intend such features to afford light-hearted and humorous augmentation of everyday conversations, I wanted to see if similar features could be remixed for making rhetorical arguments.",
                      "Data is not really useful unless you integrate storytelling and interactivity into it. I’ve realized that we need to create experiences where people can interact and immerse themselves with the data which can then rhetorically inspire them to take action. This is a great space for STEM and humanities scholars to come together to create such experiences. In this visualization, my purpose was to create something that would help people to understand that statistics about social inequities are not just external, distant facts out there in the world, but that they are a part of us and often we are complicit in them. In this augmented reality (AR) visualization, you see two pie charts that get superimposed on users’ faces. The two pie charts consist of two types of populations in the US in 2021. The outer pie chart consists of the national population for different racial groups, while the inner pie chart consists of the prison population for those groups. Each colored ring in the two pie charts represents a particular racial group. Despite only representing 13.43% of America’s national population, Black Americans make up 33.6% of the incarcerated population in the US (Zeng, 2022). On the other hand, while white Americans make up 76.3% of the national population, they represent only 49.4% of the prison population (Zeng, 2022). This means that in terms of representational ratios, for every 1% of African Americans in the national population, there are 2.5% in the prison population while for every 1% of white Americans in the national population, there are only 0.65% in the prison population. Black Americans are thus nearly 4 times more overrepresented in prisons compared to their white counterparts. The specific form of this visualization seeks to serve three rhetorical purposes. First, by concatenating proportions of national and prison populations of different racial groups in the US in the form of concentric circles, it seeks to make the concept of representational ratios—which is an important concept in understanding how social inequities work—more accessible and comprehensible to the general population. By contrasting the sizes of the different rings in the pie charts for each racial group, users can make inferences about the data. Second, by projecting these pie charts directly onto users’ faces, the visualization seeks to drive home the point that these statistics are not out there in a distant world, but we are very much a part of them. Thirdly, by providing users with an ability to take photos and videos and circulate them on social media, the visualization provides affordances for such multimodal work to have a greater rhetorical velocity (Ridolfo and Devoss, 2009) that facilitates its circulation and adaptation across multiple social media contexts.",

                      "I created this using an app called 8th Wall which allows users to create AR experiences. This app has pre-made templates that can be customized even with a limited or no understanding of computer coding. Users who have some understanding of coding, especially in the language called Javascript, can create more sophisticated and customized visualizations. For this particular visualization, I used a built-in template for creating face effects in 8th Wall that uses a Javascript library called “aframe” (8th Wall Inc, 2022a). This template provides a basic framework for creating visual elements that can be projected on users’ faces. How this works is that the 8th Wall engine analyzes facial features in the users’ front camera. As it recognises the users’ nose, it uses that as its anchor point and then arranges visual elements around that can be tweaked and defined by developers. I used aframe’s built-in shape features to create multiple rings that would give the appearance of the two pie charts in the visualization. It took several hours of trial and error to get the distances and ratios right to match the data that I wanted to represent. I used prison data that was publicly available from Zeng (2022) and national population data from US Census Bureau (2022). Since my own coding literacy is developing, I was very thankful to the detailed documentation provided by the 8th wall developer community (8th wall Inc., 2022a). Additionally, taking inspiration from Eyman’s (2023) experiments with using OpenAI’s ChatGPT for web design, I also used ChatGPT to assist me with brainstorming coding ideas and with debugging the code that I had written. Any coding suggestions given by ChatGPT were reviewed closely by me and corrected for errors."
