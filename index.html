        <h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          The 1900 Paris Exposition hosted countries from around the world to reflect on their individual achievements and ambitions for the new century. These primarily Western nations created elaborate displays to showcase their past and present technological and cultural prowess in contrast with exhibits of literal human zoos, "primitive people" from different regions of Africa and Latin America. This colonialist agenda led Thomas Junius Calloway to successfully appeal to the U.S. government to allow Black Americans to create their own counteractive exhibit that would be viewed by millions at the upcoming world’s fair. With such a monumentally important task, Calloway, a Black lawyer and educator, enlisted his former Fisk University classmate, W.E.B. Du Bois’, help. The desires of Calloway and Du Bois perfectly meshed in the Du Bois-led Atlanta University team’s creation of various charts and diagrams that were equally informationally rich as they were visually arresting. The Exposition des Negres d’Amérique astounded viewers of all races and went on to receive much critical acclaim. Their success proved without a shadow of a doubt that Black progress was a product of our own self-determination in spite of the constant onslaught of systematic racism.

        <p class="section-text">
          Today, we stand 123 years from this triumphant display, twenty-three years from the start of a new millennium, and three years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the police executions of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At this important juncture, Hello Black World: DuBois, Data, and the Black Experience walks in Du Bois’ footsteps to methodically consider how we have waxed and waned in our progression. Du Bois clearly understood that simply collecting the data was not enough, but it also needed to be presented in a way that was accessible and engaging for the everyday person. Hello Black World pushes Du Bois’ model further by incorporating 3D visuals, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The collaborative project, spearheaded by Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume of Howard University and Dr. Bryan Carter of the University of Arizona, utilizes technology to harness the power of our ever-present smartphones and enhance the physical surroundings with layered virtual visuals. With visual effects, VR, and AR, this new exhibit allows viewers to easily compare the statistical 2D graphs of DuBois’ time with present information in the 3D.

              <p class="ss-text" id="inspo">
                Prior to his contributions to the Exposition des Negres d'Amérique in 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois conducted the first sociological case study of an American urban community in
                 his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study. As highlighted by Aldon Morris, “the achievement of The Philadelphia Negro was that it was steeped in empirical 
                 data with charts and graphs, which enabled Du Bois to chronicle and analyze the experience of Black Philadelphians at the turn of the twentieth century.” 
                 In <i>Death Rate of Philadelphia by Age Periods, For 1890</i>, the viewer experiences how Du Bois's persistent use of data visualization highlights the inequities between 
                 life expectancy between Black and white citizens of Philadelphia during this time through a simple set of bar graphs. The 3D data visualization highlights how, in 2023, 
                 Black people still had a shorter life expectancy in comparison to white people and fared worse than whites across the majority of 32 examined measures of health according 
                 to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Between 2019 and 2020, the life expectancy for all races/ethnicities declined. However, Black people saw a decrease from 74.7 to 71.8 years.
