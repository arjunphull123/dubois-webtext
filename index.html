        <h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          The 1900 Paris Exposition hosted countries from around the world to reflect on their individual achievements and ambitions for the new century. These primarily Western nations created elaborate displays to showcase their past and present technological and cultural prowess in contrast with exhibits of literal human zoos, "primitive people" from different regions of Africa and Latin America. This colonialist agenda led Thomas Junius Calloway to successfully appeal to the U.S. government to allow Black Americans to create their own counteractive exhibit that would be viewed by millions at the upcoming world’s fair. With such a monumentally important task, Calloway, a Black lawyer and educator, enlisted his former Fisk University classmate, W.E.B. Du Bois’, help. The desires of Calloway and Du Bois perfectly meshed in the Du Bois-led Atlanta University team’s creation of various charts and diagrams that were equally informationally rich as they were visually arresting. The Exposition des Negres d’Amérique astounded viewers of all races and went on to receive much critical acclaim. Their success proved without a shadow of a doubt that Black progress was a product of our own self-determination in spite of the constant onslaught of systematic racism.

          Today, we stand 123 years from this triumphant display, twenty-three years from the start of a new millennium, and three years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the police executions of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At this important juncture, Hello Black World: DuBois, Data, and the Black Experience walks in Du Bois’ footsteps to methodically consider how we have waxed and waned in our progression. Du Bois clearly understood that simply collecting the data was not enough, but it also needed to be presented in a way that was accessible and engaging for the everyday person. Hello Black World pushes Du Bois’ model further by incorporating 3D visuals, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The collaborative project, spearheaded by Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume of Howard University and Dr. Bryan Carter of the University of Arizona, utilizes technology to harness the power of our ever-present smartphones and enhance the physical surroundings with layered virtual visuals. With visual effects, VR, and AR, this new exhibit allows viewers to easily compare the statistical 2D graphs of DuBois’ time with present information in the 3D.
