        <h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          The 1900 Paris Exposition hosted countries from around the world to reflect on their individual achievements and ambitions for the new century. These primarily Western nations created elaborate displays to showcase their past and present technological and cultural prowess in contrast with exhibits of literal human zoos, "primitive people" from different regions of Africa and Latin America. This colonialist agenda led Thomas Junius Calloway to successfully appeal to the U.S. government to allow Black Americans to create their own counteractive exhibit that would be viewed by millions at the upcoming world's fair. With such a monumentally important task, Calloway, a Black lawyer and educator, enlisted the help of his former Fisk University classmate, W.E.B. Du Bois. The desires of Calloway and Du Bois perfectly meshed in the Du Bois-led Atlanta University team's creation of various charts and diagrams that were equally informationally rich as they were visually arresting. The Exposition des Negres d'Amérique astounded viewers of all races and went on to receive much critical acclaim. Their success proved without a shadow of a doubt that Black progress was a product of our own self-determination in spite of the constant onslaught of systematic racism.
        </p><p class="section-text">
          Today, we stand 123 years from this triumphant display, twenty-three years from the start of a new millennium, and three years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the police executions of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At this important juncture, Hello Black World: DuBois, Data, and the Black Experience walks in Du Bois' footsteps to methodically consider how we have waxed and waned in our progression. Du Bois clearly understood that simply collecting the data was not enough; rather, it needed to be presented in a way that was accessible and engaging for the everyday person. Hello Black World pushes Du Bois' model further by incorporating 3D visuals, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The collaborative project was spearheaded by Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume of Howard University and Dr. Bryan Carter of the University of Arizona and developed by Arjun Phull, Anuj Gupta, and Duo Bao of the University of Arizona. Hello Black World utilizes technology to harness the power of our ever-present smartphones and enhance the physical surroundings with layered virtual visuals. With visual effects, VR, and AR, this new exhibit allows viewers to easily compare the statistical 2D graphs of DuBois' time with present information in the 3D.
        </p><p class="section-text">
          Apart from DuBois' path breaking work, there are several other sources from contemporary scholarship in digital rhetoric, technical communication, and Africana studies that have inspired our work. First, through Beveridge's (2017) recommendation for teachers to make data-driven arguments more accessible and meaningful to their students through data visualizations, the data visualizations in our initial exhibition and now in this webtext, seek to encourage students and teachers to explore the world around them using the power of data-driven storytelling. Additionally, our work also responds to Meloncon and Warner's (2017) advice for future technical-professional communication scholars to pay attention to the affordances provided by innovative, interactive visualizations as they can enhance the work of science communication. Through the Hello Black World exhibition, we've tried to make a kind of science—data science—more accessible to the public at Howard University by communicating its impact and purpose in an engaging and accessible way using interactive data visualizations. Finally, one of our major sources of inspiration is also Washington et al.'s (2021) advocacy in favor of integrating the rich legacy of HBCU culture into computing education, specifically teaching elementary data structures. By incorporating unique cultural perspectives, such as historical context and experiences, they argue that educators can enhance student engagement and understanding of fundamental data structures in the computing field. A similar approach was forged with the Hello Black World exhibit, bridging cultural relevance with technical education, providing a novel approach to enriching the learning experience for potential data science students.

        <h3>VISUALIZATIONS.</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          The Hello Black World exhibit adopted a multimodal approach in scientific communication. Recognizing the historical underrepresentation of people of African descent in the field of data science, despite the pioneering efforts of researchers like Du Bois, the aim was to create an exhibit that demonstrated the power of data science as accessible and inclusive. By incorporating a diverse array of modalities in data visualizations—such as textual, visual, spatial, gestural, and immersive elements—the exhibit pulled in viewers of all ages into the field of data. Utilizing 3D visuals, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), video, and audio, seven (7) exhibitions were created, each linked to a historical Du Bois diagram exploring diverse facets of Black life, such as income, education, criminal justice, housing, health, and environmental justice, alongside corresponding contemporary data. The exhibit exposed visitors to Du Bois' diverse work and empowered them to gain an interdisciplinary understanding of the power of data.
        </p><p class="section-text"> Our webtext broadens the project's scope beyond Howard University's walls. To enhance accessibility, we begin by offering a 360-degree tour of the exhibit space. Corresponding pages then present each individual visualization along with an audio-visual depiction of a historical Du Bois visualization, commentary connecting contemporary data, and insights from the creators of the visualizations. Additionally, the web text includes reflections from attendees of the exhibit, providing an intergenerational perspective and showcasing the practical application of the exhibit.
        </p><p class="editor-note">
          Note to Editors: we will add audio commentary to enhance each visualization once our webtext content is finalized. We will also implement a Reflections page, allowing for visitors to the exhibit to leave their own commentary and feedback.

              <p class="ss-text" id="inspo">
                Prior to his contributions to the Exposition des Negres d'Amérique in 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois conducted the first sociological case study of an American urban community in
                 his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study. As highlighted by Aldon Morris, “the achievement of The Philadelphia Negro was that it was steeped in empirical 
                 data with charts and graphs, which enabled Du Bois to chronicle and analyze the experience of Black Philadelphians at the turn of the twentieth century.” 
                 In <i>Death Rate of Philadelphia by Age Periods, For 1890</i>, the viewer experiences how Du Bois's persistent use of data visualization highlights the inequities between 
                 life expectancy between Black and white citizens of Philadelphia during this time through a simple set of bar graphs. The 3D data visualization highlights how, in 2023, 
                 Black people still had a shorter life expectancy in comparison to white people and fared worse than whites across the majority of 32 examined measures of health according 
                 to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Between 2019 and 2020, the life expectancy for all races/ethnicities declined. However, Black people saw a decrease from 74.7 to 71.8 years.
